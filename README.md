This HTML document creates an interactive relaxation webpage called "Tranquil Mind." It is designed to help users unwind, reduce stress, and feel calmer through various interactive elements. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:
1. Navigation Bar
Contains buttons that allow users to jump to different sections of the page when clicked.
Uses scrollToSection(sectionId) (which would be defined in JavaScript) to smoothly navigate to different sections.
2. Home Section
Serves as a welcoming introduction, explaining the purpose of the site.
Describes available features like soothing sounds, breathing exercises, games, and journaling to promote relaxation.
3. Sounds Section
Allows users to play relaxing nature sounds by clicking buttons.
Each button calls playSound('file_path') (which would be a JavaScript function) to play a corresponding sound:
Birds (birds.wav)
Waves (waves.wav)
Rain (rain.wav)
